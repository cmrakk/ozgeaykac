    <h2><strong>Ozge Aykac</strong></h2>
    <p>
      Hello everyone! My name is Ozge Aykac, and I'm thrilled to welcome you to my personal blog. I'm pursuing my studies in Engineering and Management, currently based in the country of Slovenia. However, I was born and raised in the vibrant land of Turkey, which holds a special place in my heart.

    <p>
      Ever since I was a child, I have been interested in the way things work and how they can be improved. This curiosity made me choose a career path in Industrial Engineering, where I can apply my problem-solving skills and analytical mindset to optimize processes and increase efficiency in industries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Living and studying in Slovenia has been an incredible experience so far. This country's culture and nature always inspire me. Seeing the global impact of industrial engineering has broadened my perspective.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this blog, I want to share my experiences and discoveries related to industrial engineering, academic life, and my personal journey. Join me!
